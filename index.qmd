**`AbangSmith`** is a Shiny application that is designed to explore and analyse the spatial relationships between crime rates and socio-economic factors in Malaysia, such as unemployment rates and income inequality. Leveraging interactive visualisations and geospatial analysis, the application provides users with the tools to uncover regional crime disparities and patterns. By integrating data-driven insights with user-friendly functionality, the platform aims to support researchers, policymakers, and community stakeholders in understanding the drivers of criminal activity.

The application features a range of exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools, such as histograms, boxplots, and spatial maps, allowing users to visualise and analyse crime data alongside relevant socio-economic indicators. Through these capabilities, users can identify trends, patterns, and potential hotspots of criminal activity. The ultimate goal of this tool is to facilitate informed decision-making and empower targeted policy interventions to promote public safety and social equity across Malaysia.

The Shiny application comprises of three pages:

-   **Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Allows to generate histogram, box-plot, choropleth maps and LISA map consisting of socio-economic factors.

-   **Geographically Weighted Regression**:

-   **Global and Local Spatial Autocorrelation**: Allows user to perform Global and Local Moran on the dataset, and plot maps to visualise it. Also allowing users to perform emerging hot spot analysis
